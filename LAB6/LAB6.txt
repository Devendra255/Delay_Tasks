1. Print the first 10 natural numbers using for loop

for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)


2. Python program to check if the given string is a palindrome

word = input("Enter the word: ")

for i in range(len(word)):
    if word[i] != word[len(word)-i-1]:
        print("The word is not a palindrome")
        break
else:
    print("The word is a palindrome")


3. Python program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number

num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
temp = num
sum = 0
while temp > 0:
    rem = temp % 10
    sum = sum + rem ** 3 # this only works for 3 digit numbers
    temp = temp // 10
if num == sum:
    print(num, "is an Armstrong number")
else:
    print(num, "is not an Armstrong number")


4. Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50

'''
# this program gives the first 50 fibonacci numbers
n1 = 0
n2 = 1
n3 = 0
count = 0

print("Fibonacci Series: ")
while count < 50:
    print(n1)
    n3 = n1 + n2
    n1 = n2
    n2 = n3
    count += 1
'''
# this program gives the fibonacci series between 0 to 50
n1 = 0
n2 = 1
n3 = 0
count = 0
print("Fibonacci Series: ")
while n1 <= 50:
    print(n1)
    n3 = n1 + n2
    n1 = n2
    n2 = n3


5. Python program to check the validity of password input by users

password = input("Enter the password: ")
con_pass = input("Enter the confirm password: ")

if password == con_pass:
    print("Password is valid")
else:
    print("Password is not valid")
