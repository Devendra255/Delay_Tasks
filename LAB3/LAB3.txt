1. Python program to check leap year

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0:
    print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year")


2. Python Program to Find the Largest Among Three Numbers

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
    print(f"{num1} is the largest number")
elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
    print(f"{num2} is the largest number")
else:
    print(f"{num3} is the largest number")


3. Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or 0

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
    print(f"{num} is a positive number")
elif num < 0:
    print(f"{num} is a negative number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is zero")


4. A toy vendor supplies three types of toys: Battery Based Toys, Key-based
Toys, and Electrical Charging Based Toys. The vendor gives a discount of
10% on orders for battery-based toys if the order is for more than Rs. 1000.
On orders of more than Rs. 100 for key-based toys, a discount of 5% is
given, and a discount of 10% is given on orders for electrical charging based
toys of value more than Rs. 500. Assume that the numeric codes 1,2 and 3
are used for battery based toys, key-based toys, and electrical charging based
toys respectively. Write a program that reads the product code and the order
amount and prints out the net amount that the customer is required to pay
after the discount.

print("Product code: 1 - Battery Based Toys\nProduct code: 2 - Key-based Toys\nProduct code: 3 - Electrical Charging Based Toys")

product_code = int(input("Enter the product code: "))
order_amount = float(input("Enter the order amount: "))

if product_code == 1 and order_amount > 1000:
    discount = 0.1
elif product_code == 2 and order_amount > 100:
    discount = 0.05
elif product_code == 3 and order_amount > 500:
    discount = 0.1
else:
    discount = 0

net_amount = order_amount - (order_amount * discount)

print(f"Net amount: {net_amount}, Discount: {discount*100}%")


5. A transport company charges the fare according to following table:
Distance    Charges
1-50        8 Rs./Km
51-100      10 Rs./Km
> 100       12 Rs/Km

distance = int(input("Enter the distance: "))

if distance <= 0:
    print("Invalid distance")
elif distance <= 50:
    fare = distance * 8
    print("Total fare:", fare)
elif distance > 50 and distance <= 100:
    fare = distance * 10
    print("Total fare:", fare)
else:
    fare = distance * 12
    print("Total fare:", fare)
